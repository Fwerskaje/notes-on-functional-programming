Cubical Type Theory: lectures
=============================

This folder contains four lectures given by Anders at Inria Sophia
Antipolis in May-June 2017. The lectures cover the main features of
the system and doesn't assume any prior knowledge of homotopy type
theory or univalent foundations. Only basic familiarity with type
theory and proof assistants based on type theory (e.g. Coq or Agda) is
assumed.

The contents of the lectures are:

###  lecture1.ctt
* Basic features of the base type theory
* A little bit of Path types (Path abstraction and application)

### lecture2.ctt
* More on Path types (symmetry and connections)
* Compositions

### lecture3.ctt
* Higher dimensional compositions
* Transport and J for Path types
* Fill
* H-levels (contractible types, propositions, sets, groupoids...)

### lecture4.ctt
* Equivalences
* Glue types
* Proofs of the univalence axiom

The lectures hence give a hands-on introduction covering sections 2-7
of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02108).
